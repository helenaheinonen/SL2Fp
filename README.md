# SL2Fp

This is code I wrote for a SURA summer research project under the supervision of Henri Darmon, McGill University. 

It finds the elements of the finite group SL2(Fp), their corresponding permutatation representations in the Steinberg Representation, as well as the orbits of various lines under this action.
